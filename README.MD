# Notification using fcm with php

‚ö† Make sure you already install

<li> Composer <br><br>

‚ö† If you dont have hosting server, you can use this for local server

<li> XAMPP
<li> Laragon <br><br>

‚ö† Make sure your php version is >= 8.2

## Setup the folder vendor

Downlaod the [vendor.zip](https://) and extract, if you using hosting server just upload the zip and extract with script [php-unzipper](https://github.com/Agellls/php-unzipper)

After that run script [VAPID.php]() in terminal like this :

```php
//make you already inside directory of this file
php VAPID.php
```

The output that script is like :

```php
[publicKey] => BGqoaIRHEkppgVKPv2ReZMV7YbJS_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
[privateKey] => 1tbvzTeoSMP6bWQ0O_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Make sure you save that public key and private key

## Configure your index key & send key

You can edit [index.html]() like you want. not like my example. but you need change this line with you previus public key

```js
sw.pushManager.subscribe({
  userVisibleOnly: true,
  applicationServerKey: "#ChangeWithYourPublicKey",
});
```

Now edit the file [send.php]() and report notification

```php
$auth = [
    'VAPID' => [
        'subject' => 'mailto:#ChangeWithYourEmail',
        'publicKey' => '#ChangeWithYourPublicKey',
        'privateKey' => '#ChangeWithYourPrivateKey',
    ],
];
```

```php
$report = $webPush->sendOneNotification(
    Subscription::create($subscriptionData),
    json_encode([
        "title" => "#YourTitleNotif",
        "body" => "#YourTitleNotif",
        "url" => "#InpuYourLinkRedirectNotif",
        "delay" => $delayInSeconds // Delay in seconds
    ]),
    ['TTL' => 5000]
);
```

The setup for notificaiton ready now, the next is how to call or show the notif on user

# Get subcription notification

Now open your index.html it will show like this
![index ui](assets/image.png)

Then click enable notif it will need permision notif like this
![notif ui](assets/image2.png)

Just click allow or enable, the output index will be show like this
![output ui](assets/image3.png)

Copy the text on bottom, we need that for send the notification to user

# Show or send notification to user

Just call the file [send.php]() like this :

https://#YourDomainOrLocalhost/send.php?time=5&alert=#YourSubscriptionText

```js
// this for defined when the notif show in users
time = 5  // in this case i used 5, it mean 5 second

// this for defined where notif send to users
alert = #YourSubscriptionText //just copy the subscription from index here
```
